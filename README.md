# Hangman Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic **Hangman** game. Players attempt to guess a hidden word, letter by letter, before running out of attempts.

## Features

- **Word Selection**: Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can input guesses via the command-line interface.
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays the correctly guessed letters and the remaining attempts.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs (e.g., multiple letters or non-alphabetic characters).
- **Replay Option**: Allows players to play multiple rounds.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/masood2004/hangman_game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd hangman_game
   ```

3. **Ensure Python is installed**:

   - This project requires Python 3.x. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Input your guesses, one letter at a time.
   - View your progress and remaining attempts after each guess.

3. **Win or Lose**:
   - Win by guessing the entire word correctly within the allowed attempts.
   - Lose if you run out of attempts before guessing the word.

## Example

Here‚Äôs an example interaction:

```
Welcome to Hangman!
_ _ _ _ _ (5 letters)
Guess a letter: e
_ e _ _ _ (Correct!)
Guess a letter: t

Guess a letter: r
